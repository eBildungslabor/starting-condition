### Starting condition
```

Hard enough with one.
Random is no fun.
...starting-condition!
```

npm i start
```

### Usage

# Who was the last person to make a sandwich?

start -t computers
```

### Contributing
1. Starting conditions should be general enough that anyone could reasonably meet the condition.
2. Starting conditions should be appropriate for a wide audience.
3. No profane language.
4. Wording should be careful.
5. People should feel good or neutral after hearing your condition
