# Poem
How do you start?
Its hard enough with one.
And random is no fun.
Try starting-condition!

```
npm i start
start
# Who was the last person to make a sandwich?

start -l es
# Quien despertó lo más temprano

start -t computers
```

# Contributing
Read the [Contribution Guidelines](#); here is the gist:

1. Starting conditions should be general enough that anyone could reasonably meet the condition.
2. Starting conditions should be appropriate for a wide audience.
3. No profane language.
4. Wording should be careful.
5. People should feel good or neutral after hearing your condition
