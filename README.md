With `starting-condition`, you and your group discuss who meets the
stated starting condition.

### Contributing
#### Architecture
1. Starting conditions are stored in a single file of their corresponding language (eg: English is `en.txt`)
2. Each line is a starting condition to be chosen at random.

#### Guidlines
1. Starting conditions should be general enough that anyone could reasonably meet the condition.
2. Starting conditions should be appropriate for a wide audience.
3. No profane language.
4. Wording should be careful.
5. People should feel good or neutral after hearing your condition

#### Language support
`starting-condition` currently supports English and Spanish languages. If you'd like
